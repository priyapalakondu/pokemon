Run 'npm install' to install dependencies in root level folder path

Run 'npm install' to install dependencies in 'frontend' folder path

Port 5000 is used as server

Port 3000 is used as frontend 

Run 'npm run dev' in root level folder path

In the browser run the url localhost:5000 so that the backend API is available for frontend to consume

Run localhost:3000 in the browser

Enter the name of the pkemon in the textbox and click n search

An result will be shown in an aler box

#Part 2 - Theory

Testing: 
Develop unit tests to ensure the API functions correctly. Test different input scenarios, such as providing Pokémon names or IDs that have various evolution chains. Verify that the API returns the expected evolution chain and variations in the response.
For testing, both unit tests and integration tests should be implemented. Unit tests can be created for individual functions and components of the application, while integration tests can verify the correct behavior of the API endpoints. Additionally, it's important to test various edge cases, such as Pokémon with complex evolution chains or rare scenarios that may impact the API's functionality.

Deployment and Releases: 
Set up a deployment process for the API. This could involve containerization (e.g., Docker), a cloud provider (e.g., AWS or Google Cloud), and an orchestration tool (e.g., Kubernetes) to manage deployments and releases. Automate the deployment process to ensure seamless updates and rollbacks.
Regarding deployments and releases, a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline can be set up to automate the deployment process. The pipeline can be triggered upon code changes or manual triggers, run tests, build the application, and deploy it to a staging or production environment. Rolling updates or blue-green deployments can be used to minimize downtime during releases.

API Versioning and Management: 
Consider versioning the API to ensure compatibility and manage changes over time. Include a version number in the API endpoints (e.g., /v1/pokemon/evolution-chain). Document the API thoroughly, including information about its endpoints, request/response structures, and any potential changes or deprecations.

Non-functional Requirements: 
Consider non-functional requirements such as performance, scalability, security, and error handling. Optimize API performance by caching responses or implementing rate limiting. Ensure the application handles errors gracefully, returning appropriate error responses for invalid inputs or failed API requests. Implement security measures such as authentication and authorization if necessary.


Designing the API: 
Define the endpoints and request/response structures. For this task, we'll have a single endpoint that accepts a Pokémon name or ID and returns the evolution chain and its variations in the response.

UI Integration: 
If desired, develop a frontend application that consumes the API. The UI could provide a user-friendly interface for entering Pokémon names or IDs and displaying the evolution chain and variations.
